      My interests and hobbies include: watching movies and tv shows, fishing, going to the gym, and hanging out with friends.
      Some of my favorite movies are The Bench Warmers and Interstellar. i have gone fishing in a couple different countries. ive been trying togo to the gym 5 days a week
      so i can get big af. Finally i love hanging out with my friends because they put me in a positive mind set. i love having people around me that push me 
      to be a better person.
